Practical 1- Aim: Implementing a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm (e.g. to classify handwritten digits).

Practical 2-Aim: Building a decision tree model using the ID3 algorithm (e.g. to predict whether a customer will churn or not).

Practical 3-Aim: Developing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model (e.g. to classify email messages as spam or not spam).

Practical 4- Building a Naïve Bayes Classifier (e.g. to classify movie reviews as positive or negative sentiment)

Practical 5- Implementing linear regression to predict housing prices based on features such as size and location

Practical 6- Using logistic regression to predict whether a credit card transaction isfraudulent or not.

Practical 7-Evaluating a classification model using metrics such as accuracy, precision,recall, and F1 score.

Practical 8-Applying hierarchical clustering to group customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.

Practical 9-Implementing the K-means clustering algorithm to identify distinct clusters in a customer demographic dataset.

Practical 10-  Utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to improve the efficiency and interpretability of a model.
